# Patient Simulator Project

This project aims to create a patient simulator that models the effects of various tests and treatments on patient conditions and outcomes. By simulating different scenarios and treatments, the goal is to fill in gaps in knowledge about patient treatments and to explore untried methodologies.

### Overview
The core of this project revolves around a `Patient` class that encapsulates body information and allows for the application of tests and treatments. The primary objective is to simulate patient outcomes based on these interventions.

### Project Structure
- `Patient.py`: Contains the `Patient` class with properties for body information and methods for conducting tests and treatments.
- `UserInterface/`: Directory for the user interface files.
- `Simulation/`: Directory for simulation logic and statistics generation.
- `Tests/`: Directory for unit tests and test data.

### User Interface
The project utilizes a Progressive Web App (PWA) for its user interface. Users can interact with the simulation by selecting various tests and treatments for the patient. The interface provides options for choosing interventions and observing their effects on patient conditions.

### Functionality
- **Simulation:** Generates patient behavior and physiology based on implemented models.
- **Tests & Treatments:** Users can apply different tests and treatments to observe their impact on the patient's condition.
- **Relationship Statistics:** Utilizes statistics to simulate realistic patient behaviors and physiology.
- **Gap Analysis:** Runs simulations against themselves to identify knowledge gaps and recommend treatments or interventions.

### Implementation
The project will involve implementing:
- Detailed models for patient behavior and physiology.
- Test and treatment mechanisms that affect the patient's condition.
- Algorithms for relationship statistics and knowledge gap identification.
- PWA-based user interface for interactive simulations.

### Future Development
Future enhancements may include:
- Integration of machine learning for predictive patient outcomes.
- Expanded database of tests, treatments, and patient scenarios.
- Refinement of statistical models for more accurate simulations.

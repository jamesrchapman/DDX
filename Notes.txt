Okay, well we have patients

Class Patient:
properties:
Body information (as required to give test info)
methods:
Tests
Treatments

So, that's a cool idea, I guess first thing is a proof of concept, and then building models based on the data and trying to fill in the blanks on patient treatments and outcomes, right? 

It could be interesting just to know what sort of things aren't really known or tried.. 


So, what would we want for user interface? 

Well I'd just to a pwa because that's the easiest thing. 

Then the user selects from a variety of tests and treatments they'd like to apply to the patient (including waiting) and we see how the test results and treatments affect the patient and their conditions. 

So, in order to achieve all of this I think we have to implement some relationship statistics, right? because we want to generate patients and their behaviors and physiology realistically. 

Then I was thinking we could sort of run this process against itself to find gaps in knowledge, e.g. we don't know what happens when we apply x in situation a, and to find procedural behaviors that work very well, or to find recommendations for patient treatment in a vacuum.
